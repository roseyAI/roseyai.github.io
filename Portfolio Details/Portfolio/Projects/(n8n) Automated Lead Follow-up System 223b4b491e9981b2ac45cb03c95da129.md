**What's the problem?**

- It takes too much time to keep track of new potential customers (leads).
- Sometimes we're slow to reply to them.
- This means we might miss out on sales.

**My Solution:**
I built an automatic system to talk to new leads. It makes sure we respond fast and always send the right message. This saves time and helps us get more customers!

**How it Helps (The Good Stuff):**

- **More Sales:** Helps us turn **35-65% more leads into customers** by talking to them regularly.
- **Saves Time:** Frees up **3-7 hours each week** that used to be spent manually dealing with leads.
- **Fast Replies:** We reply to leads in **minutes**, not hours or days.
- **Clear Messages:** All our messages to potential customers are consistent and clear.
- **Learn What Works:** It shows us which messages and timing work best, so we can keep getting better.

**How it Works (Step-by-Step):**

1. **New Lead Appears:** When a new lead is added (like in a spreadsheet), the system instantly notices.
2. **First Email:** It immediately sends a welcome email to the new lead.
3. **Update Status:** The system marks the lead's status to show they've received the first email.
4. **Watches for Replies:** It keeps an eye out for any emails back from the lead.
5. **Status Changes:** If the lead replies, their status is changed to "Responded" right away.
6. **Smart Follow-Up:**
    - The system waits for 3 days.
    - After 3 days, it checks if the lead has replied.
    - **If they HAVEN'T replied:** It sends a follow-up email.
    - **If they HAVE replied:** It does nothing, because a person can take over from there.
