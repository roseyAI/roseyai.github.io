- **Spa Appointment Scheduler**: Clients could book treatments, check available time slots, and receive reminders about upcoming appointments.
- **Staff Schedule Management**: Help staff check their upcoming shifts or appointments directly through Telegram.
- **Service Customization**: Collect customer preferences (like dietary restrictions for restaurants or treatment preferences for spas) through guided conversation flows.
