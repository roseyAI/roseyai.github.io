I planned and executed a fully automated giveaway for a Shopify store using the Social Boost app that delivered exceptional results. 

I built a custom landing page in Shopify, configured viral sharing features, and integrated it with ActiveCampaign to capture and segment leads automatically.

The campaign generated remarkable growth with zero manual work post-launch: 

**Instagram Growth:**

- Followers: 527% increase (from 118 to 740 followers)

**Email List Growth:**

- ActiveCampaign: 6,150% increase (from 8 to 500+ subscribers)

More insights:

- 18,200 views
- The giveaway drove 526 unique visitors and 4,900 website visits, with strong engagement including 173 likes and 351 comments on the main Instagram post.
