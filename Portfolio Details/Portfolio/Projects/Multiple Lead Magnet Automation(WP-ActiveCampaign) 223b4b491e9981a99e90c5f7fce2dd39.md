**The Problem:**

My client's WordPress form wasn't connected to ActiveCampaign, resulting in lost leads and manual work. Their team was manually sending PDFs to prospects who requested them, causing delays and inconsistent follow-up.

**My Solution:**

I built a custom form directly in ActiveCampaign and designed this automation workflow to automatically deliver different PDF resources based on the contact's profile and needs. The workflow:

- Triggers immediately when someone submits on the new form requesting a PDF download
- Uses conditional logic to route contacts through appropriate pathways based on their information
- Automatically sends targeted emails with the relevant PDF (Sales, PM, or HR versions) attached
- Tags contacts based on which resource they downloaded for better segmentation

**The Results:**

This automation eliminated the manual process completely. Now when prospects request information, they receive the appropriate PDF instantly. Their team saves approximately 5-10 hours per week that was previously spent on manual follow-ups.
