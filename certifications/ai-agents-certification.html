                        <h2>Projects Built During Certification</h2>
                        <p>As part of the AI Advantage for Professionals BOOST CAMP, I built two AI solutions to demonstrate my understanding of prompt engineering, AI agents, and no-code development:</p>

                        <div class="cert-project">
                            <h3>Project 1: Gym Attendance Tracker App</h3>

                            <h4>Problem:</h4>
                            <p>Small gyms lack affordable tech to track client attendance and identify members at risk of cancelling. Without proper tracking systems, gym owners struggle to spot engagement patterns and often lose members without knowing why.</p>

                            <h4>Solution:</h4>
                            <p>Built a comprehensive no-code app that serves both gym members and owners. Gym-goers can track their attendance streaks, set personal fitness goals, and receive personalized motivational messages based on their activity patterns. On the owner side, the dashboard highlights at-risk members who haven't visited recently, allowing owners to create tailored rewards and interventions to re-engage them before they cancel their memberships.</p>

                            <h4>Key Features:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Attendance streak tracking with visual progress indicators</li>
                                <li>Personalized motivation based on individual attendance patterns</li>
                                <li>At-risk member identification dashboard for gym owners</li>
                                <li>Customizable reward system to incentivize visits</li>
                                <li>User-friendly interface accessible on mobile and desktop</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>What I Learned:</h4>
                            <p>This project taught me how to design intuitive interfaces that work for two different user types (members and owners), create seamless user experiences in no-code platforms, and think through the complete user journey from onboarding to ongoing engagement.</p>

                            <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Lovable (no-code platform)</p>

                            <h3>Project 2: AI Content Planning Agent</h3>

                            <h4>Problem:</h4>
                            <p>Content creators spend hours researching trends and writing scripts manually, slowing down their content production. The process of finding viral topics, understanding what's trending, and crafting engaging scripts is repetitive and time-consuming, often taking 3-5 hours per video.</p>

                            <h4>Solution:</h4>
                            <p>Created an intelligent AI agent that automates the entire content planning workflow from start to finish. The agent begins by asking users targeted questions about their niche and content goals, then conducts autonomous research on viral and trending topics relevant to their audience. Using advanced prompt engineering, it generates complete video scripts with attention-grabbing hooks, engaging body content, and compelling captions optimized for social media platforms. All outputs are automatically organized in Google Docs with proper formatting, and the creator receives instant Slack notifications when their content package is ready.</p>

                            <h4>Workflow:</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>User provides their content niche and preferences</li>
                                <li>AI agent researches current viral trends and high-performing topics</li>
                                <li>Analyzes what's working in the creator's niche</li>
                                <li>Generates complete video scripts with hooks and CTAs</li>
                                <li>Creates social media captions for multiple platforms</li>
                                <li>Delivers formatted content to Google Docs</li>
                                <li>Sends completion notification via Slack</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>What I Learned:</h4>
                            <p>Building this agent showed me how crucial prompt engineering is when designing AI agents that actually work. I learned how to structure prompts to get consistent, high-quality outputs, how to chain multiple AI tasks together seamlessly, and how to design conversational flows that feel natural while gathering the right information.</p>

                            <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Zapier AI Agents, Google Docs, Slack</p>
                            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Reduced content planning time from 3-5 hours to 10 minutes, allowing creators to focus on filming and engagement rather than research and scripting.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="key-takeaway">
                            <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Combining prompt engineering, AI agent design, and no-code tools opens up endless possibilities for solving real business problems without writing code. These projects demonstrated that with the right approach, you can build sophisticated automation solutions that deliver professional-grade results.
